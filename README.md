# Brand-Tracker

📰 An automated Real-Time Brand News Tracker. Periodically fetches news RSS feeds for specific companies, extracts article content, runs local sentiment analysis, deduplicates results using SQLite, displays them in an interactive dashboard, and sends email alerts.

## Features
- **Add/Remove Companies**: Track multiple companies effortlessly through the app dashboard.
- **Automated Fetching**: Retrieves Google News RSS feeds continuously every 10 minutes in the background.
- **Email Notifications**: Alerts you via Email using Gmail SMTP when new unique articles are found.
- **Deduplication**: Saves all seen articles into a local SQLite DB to prevent duplicate alerts.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Browse fetched articles sorted by newest first.

## Application Architecture
- **Backend**: Python `feedparser` and `requests`.
- **Database**: `SQLite` (built-in).
- **Scheduling**: `APScheduler` (Background process configured to run inside Streamlit).
- **Frontend**: `Streamlit`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher.
- A Gmail account with **App Passwords** enabled for sending emails.
  - To generate an app password, go to [Google Account > Security > App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

## Setup & Local Execution

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Set the following variables on your machine or deployment platform to enable email notifications. If these are not set, articles will still be fetched and displayed on the dashboard, but you won't receive emails.

   - `GMAIL_USER`: Your email address (e.g., `you@gmail.com`).
   - `GMAIL_PASS`: Your Gmail App Password.
   - `GMAIL_RECEIVER` (optional): The email address to send to. Defaults to `GMAIL_USER`.

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The database gets automatically initialized on first run and will be stored as `news_tracker.db` in the same directory. The scheduler thread will automatically pick up and run every 10 minutes as long as the application process is alive.
